# Database Visualizer (Optional)

This folder contains a very simple Node.js/Express-based database viewer useful for local diagnostics.

Important:
- Do NOT run this viewer inside the skill_story_database container. The database container must only run PostgreSQL.
- The backend and frontend containers are the only services that should run Node.js. If you want to use this viewer, run it on your host machine or in a separate, dedicated utility container.

How to use (host machine or separate utility container):
1) Ensure you have Node.js installed (v18+ recommended).
2) From this folder:
   npm install
3) Source the environment variables generated by the DB startup (if present):
   source ./postgres.env
   # or manually set POSTGRES_URL/POSTGRES_USER/POSTGRES_PASSWORD/POSTGRES_DB/POSTGRES_PORT
4) Start the viewer:
   npm start
5) Open http://localhost:3000 to browse.

Security note:
- This viewer is for local diagnostics only. Do not expose it publicly.
- Never embed credentials in code; use environment variables.
